Fix count()

Make transact() more user-friendly

Add update(table, data, conditions, success, failure) method to update across rows

Disable logging by default, actually replace output function w/ stub or working output func.

Support LIKE "%X%" in condition-parsing. Break condition-parsing into private method.
