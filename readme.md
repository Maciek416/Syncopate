Syncopate Asynchronous Abstraction Layer
========================================

Syncopate is a simple abstraction layer on top of HTML5 (and perhaps additional async databases in the future) which can be used to easily read, write, and erase rows from the db, create and drop tables, and eventually will provide easy functionality for performing multiples of these actions nested in transactions.
